## Features
Currently, in the Pathfinder 2e system, NPCs are not affected by rules-based vision due to how the data is formatted and a potential performance impact.

For when NPC vision is important, for example an NPC with darkvision in a night scene, this module adds the rules-based vision code for NPCs.

## Compatibility
