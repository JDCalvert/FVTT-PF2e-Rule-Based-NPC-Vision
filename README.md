# FVTT-PF2e-Rule-Based-NPC-Vision
A module for the Foundry VTT PF2e system which enables rules-based vision for NPCs.

## Features
Currently, in the Pathfinder 2e system, NPCs are not affected by rules-based vision due to how the data is formatted and a potential performance impact.

For when NPC vision is important, for example an NPC with darkvision in a night scene, this module adds the rules-based vision code for NPCs.
